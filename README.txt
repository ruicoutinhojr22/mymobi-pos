CUSTOMIZATION
=============

ADDING NEW INTEGRATIONS

1. Define Integration Type
   // shared/types.ts
   export type IntegrationType = "gmail" | "slack" | "your-integration";

2. Add Integration Definition
   // client/lib/integrations.ts
   export const INTEGRATIONS: Integration[] = [
     {
       id: "your-integration",
       name: "Your Integration",
       type: "your-integration",
       description: "Description of your integration",
       icon: "YourIcon",

   ];

3. Add Icon Mapping
   // client/components/workflow/WorkflowNode.tsx
   const iconMap = {
     "your-integration": YourIcon,
     // ... other icons
   };
